ZEROTH LAYER

Chips X Mult - The way that Balatro calculates your score is by multiplying your total amount of chips by the total amount of mult (mult meaning ‘multiplier’).

Enhancements - Each playing card can be enhanced by using some specific tarot cards. There are eight enhancements: Bonus cards, Mult cards, Lucky cards, Stone cards, Gold cards, Steel cards, Wild cards and Glass cards.

Poker hands - These are the hands you can play that are brought over from regular poker.

Shop - After each round you get to see the shop, where you can buy Jokers and all kinds of cards to make you stronger and able to score more points. You can earn money during and at the end of each round, money that can be spent in the shop.

Vouchers - Every ante you’ll find in the bottom left of the shop a new voucher, these passively affect your run and each do different things.

Tarots - Consumables inspired from the Major Arcana cards, these can either help you add enhancements to the cards in your deck, make money, create other consumables and even add editions to your Jokers.

Planet Cards - Your poker hands each can be levelled, they start at level one and by using the correspondent planet card they get to the next level, having more base chips and mult this way.

Economy - The more money you have in Balatro, the more you earn each round: you get one extra dollar for each five dollars you already have (up to a base maximum of twenty-five). This means that keeping at least twenty-five dollars before entering the next blind is key to good money management.

Packs - At the bottom right of each shop there are always two packs, these packs can provide Jokers, tarots, planet cards and even playing cards.

Decks - Every deck in Balatro has a different ability, you choose the deck you’ll play before starting a run and it cannot be changed during the run. There are a total of fifteen unlockable decks in the game.

Blinds - Each round you play is either a Small Blind, Big Blind or a Boss Blind (first, second and last rounds of the ante). The Small Blind’s score requirement is the base one of the ante, the Big Blind’s one and a half that, and the Boss Blind’s (most of the time) is twice that, but can vary.

Antes - To win a run you must complete eight antes, which are groups containing each a Small Blind, a Big Blind and a Boss Blind. Antes multiples of eight will have a ‘Finisher Boss Blind’.

FIRST LAYER

Editions & Seals - Playing cards, other than their enhancement, can also have both an edition and a seal: editions change the look of the whole card to be either foil, holographic or polychrome (and these add chips, mult and Xmult); while seals look like envelope wax seals and their color determines their ability.

Spectrals - The final consumable type of the game are spectral cards, they act in a similar way to tarots except they are way stronger and more situational.

Xmult - The way you can accomplish great scores in the game is having a way to score Xmult (Multiplicative mult). A Joker scoring X3 mult will triple your mult (and so your score) if placed correctly on your Joker roster.

Scaling Jokers - These are the Jokers that don’t give a fixed amount of chips, mult or Xmult but instead start from zero and scale up, each at a different pace, when certain conditions are met.

Blueprint & Brainstorm - These two Jokers are the two best in the game, despite not doing anything by themselves, that’s because they copy the effects of the Jokers in your roster (Blueprint copies the Joker to its right and Blueprint copies the leftmost Joker). 

Deck-Fixing - The practice of changing cards in your deck to help you score certain hands is called ‘Deck-Fixing’.

Negative Cards - Negative is another edition (like foil, holographic and polychrome) that when applied to a Joker makes it not occupy any Joker slot. The same happens with consumables using Perkeo. Negative cards have their normal look color-inverted.

Skip Tags - When skipping a blind the game gives you a tag established beforehand that auto-activates and gets consumed when their condition is met.

Stakes - The difficulty of the run is determined by the stake you decided to play with your deck. White stake is the base stake, each stake after White gives stacking added challenges to your run. Gold stake is the hardest and final stake of the game in which all added challenges are present.

Game Speed - Speed at which the animations play. Default speed is 1x and maximum is 4x.

Challenges - Beside the fifteen normal decks, the game comes packed with also twenty challenge decks which act as a normal deck with added gamerules to the run.

SECOND LAYER

“e” - If you score a number of chips equal or bigger than one hundred billion the game will display it using scientific notation, with the lowest number possible being 1.0e11 (100,000,000,000). So, the ‘e’ that appears in the score stands for 10^, and the number following is the exponent.

Boss Rerolling - After getting the voucher “Director’s Cut”, a red button displaying “Reroll Boss - 10$” will appear at the top left of the screen while on the blind selection screen. By paying ten dollars it allows you to change the current Boss Blind of the ante. If you get the upgraded voucher “Ret-Con” you’ll be able to reroll the boss as many times as you can afford it.

Legendary Jokers - The highest rarity of Jokers is the “Legendary” one, there exist in the base game only five legendary Jokers: Canio, Perkeo, Triboulet, Yorick and Chicot. Yorick and Canio are Xmult scaling Jokers, Perkeo creates negative copies of a consumable in your inventory, Triboulet doubles the mult every time a queen or a king are scored and Chicot disables the Boss Blind’s effect. The only way to get a legendary Joker is via “the Soul”, a spectral card that has a 0.3% chance of appearing per slot in any Arcana or Spectral Pack. 

Retriggering Jokers - Some Jokers have the ability to “retrigger” the scoring animation of played cards or cards in hand. There are many Jokers which can retrigger played cards (like Dusk, Hack, Sock and Buskin, Hanging Chad and Seltzer) but there is only one Joker that retriggers the effect of cards held in hand, and that is the Mime. Retriggering Jokers paired with scoring Jokers have the capability of achieving massive scores well greater than most combinations of Jokers.

High Contrast - The game allows the player to change the colors of the four suits for better accessibility to the colorblind. Enabling the “High Contrast” option makes the blue detail color of all Club cards a little lighter and also makes the  detail color of all Diamond cards orange.

Plasma Deck - This deck has an unique ability among the other decks which cannot be replicated on any of the others: it balances chips and mult, which means that it calculates the mathematical average of the number of chips and mult at the end of your hand and puts that average in both the “chips” and the “mult” boxes. This deck requires a different strategy to get by in the early game, that is getting only chips Jokers because those generally have higher numbers, and then pivot to mult when you get the opportunity. In the end game of High-Score runs (runs which generally have average scores well into the e’s) what this deck basically does is giving you a quarter of the square of your mult: basically squaring your total number of chips.

Joker Stickers - By winning on a stake you get that stake’s chip color as a sticker on the top right of the Jokers that you had on your roster the moment you beat ante eight, and also in the deck selection menu on the top card of the deck you beat it in. If you have a higher sticker on your Jokers or your deck than the stake you’re playing the stickers won’t be changed; meaning, when you beat the gold stake, that’s the last sticker you’ll get. There are also in-run stickers that instances of Jokers may randomly have in the shop; they denote if a Joker is eternal, perishable or rental. Two of these three may be on a Joker at once, except for the pair of eternal and perishable.

Oops! all 6s - I’ve put this Joker as an entire entry just for its unique ability: doubling all listed probabilities. Knowing its existence can make some types of runs involving probability reliant Jokers more interesting and last longer (ex. Bloodstone, Lucky Cat, Hallucination, Business Card, Reserved Parking etc.).

Joker Order - While having an additive mult Joker and a multiplicative mult Joker is optimal positioning the latter at the right of the former to get a better score. You can also do the opposite if you purposely want a lower score in order to make more hands to maybe farm more money or more consumables.

“Friends of Jimbo” - This is a collaboration made by LocalThunk (Balatro’s creator and only developer) and some indie games. It allows users to change the default palindrome characters of the face cards with some from the indie games LocalThunk has collaborated with. This change is purely cosmetic.

Upgraded Vouchers - These are the vouchers you unlock the potential of finding at the start of the ante once you bought the base version of them. These vouchers aren’t unlocked by default in your collection and you need to do some specific tasks to add them to your collection. Some of these vouchers may do the same thing as their base vouchers, but others do entirely different things (ex. Blank does nothing but Antimatter gives +1 Joker slot).

Showman - Normally, already having a Joker or a consumable makes said Joker or consumable unable to appear again in the shop, until sold or used; Showman is a Joker that makes every card able to appear multiple times, letting you get multiples of the same Joker or consumable.

“Photochad” - It’s the community given name to the combination of the synergistic  Jokers “Photograph” and “Hanging Chad”. It is a strong and easy to use combination, since both of the Jokers are common and it just needs to have face cards in the deck. This synergy is so good that the developer has considered changing the rarity of the Joker “Hanging Chad” to uncommon, in order to make it a more balanced combination.

Luchador - If you were to find yourself upon an undefeatable Boss Blind that completely counters your build and you don’t have any of the reroll vouchers, the only way you can save yourself is by finding this Joker in the shop. When sold during a Boss Blind, Luchador disables the Boss’ effects giving you the opportunity to not lose immediately.

Incompatible Blueprint - A vast amount of Jokers work with Blueprint and Brainstorm; though, some of them don’t and are completely incompatible. Incompatible Jokers are ones that destroy cards, those that give money at the end of the round and ones that have peculiar and unique abilities like Chicot, Oops! all 6s, Mr. Bones and Showman.

THIRD LAYER

Gros Michel & Cavendish Lore - These two Jokers portray the Gros Michel and Cavendish bananas, from which they take the name. Gros Michel was the most widely diffused banana variety up to the 1950s, though at the end of decade it was struck by the so-called “Panama disease” which was terrible for the variety, since it ended up being withdrawn from the market. The next variety of banana to be commercially available was the Cavendish banana, which had fainter taste and a thicker peel. The stats on the Jokers point to what happened then: Cavendish cannot be obtained until Gros Michel is destroyed (when it gets destroyed it says “Extinct!”), and the very much lower probability of Cavendish getting destroyed also points to this.

naneinf - The maximum score in Balatro is the maximum 64-bit floating-point number, i.e. approximately 1.7976931348623157 x 10^308, if more than that is scored the score displayed will be “naneinf”, which stands for NaN (Not a Number), E (scientific notation Exponent), inf (infinite).

Baron-Mime - This type of build is one of the main two typical builds used in High-Score runs (the other being Idol-Hack). Scoring works by having the hand full of red seal kings, either of gold or steel (edition doesn’t matter here), and also the Baron and Mime Jokers. The Baron multiplies by 1.5 the mult for each king held in hand, and the Mime retriggers “held in hand” abilities; the Baron’s scoring counts as a “held in hand” ability. The remaining Joker slots can be filled with Blueprints and Brainstorms for an even better score.

Idol-Hack - This is the other main kind of build used in High-Score runs. It consists in having a retrigger Joker (which doesn’t need to be Hack but could also be Sock and Buskin or Dusk) and the Idol, a Joker that doubles the mult each time a card randomly chosen from the deck is scored. To make the Idol always choose the card you want, perfect deck-fixing is required (with every card of the deck being the same rank and suit).

Perkeo Observatory - The upgraded voucher of Telescope is a voucher named “Observatory”, which gives x1.5 mult for each planet card held in the consumable slots if specified hand (of the planet cards) is played. Observatory alone isn’t that good, since you have a maximum of three consumable slots, but having the legendary Joker Perkeo makes it a really good scoring option. Perkeo’s ability is to double a random consumable held, and it can be copied by Blueprint and Brainstorm. This means that (if the planet card is Pluto, and you’ve already got Antimatter and three Ectoplasms landing on Blueprints) if you have Perkeo and eight Blueprints you’ll be able to get nine copies of Pluto in one round, increasing the score by 38.4 times each round.

Demo Version - Before the game came out, LocalThunk released a demo version of Balatro for the people to play with reduced available Jokers and different UI in some areas.

Ante 39 - In the first eight antes the score increase is manageable and you are able to scale your Jokers faster than the blinds, though, in endless, it is not the case. After ante eight the score gets bigger and bigger every ante and eventually the base score required increments by factors of thousands each ante. At ante thirty-eight the base score requirement is 9.0e288, which still is small enough for it to be understood by the game. At ante thirty-nine the score requirement is a bit less than ten billion times bigger and so surpasses the 64-bit float limit, and gets displayed as “nan” (meaning “not a number”). Since logic operations cannot be done with “not a number” the game cannot check if your score is greater than it, so, even if you score naneinf you’ll lose.

Secret Hands - In normal poker the hands that can be made are the ones going from high card to straight flush, hands that can be made with a standard fifty-two card deck. In Balatro, the composition of the deck can be changed allowing to play three “secret” hands added to the game: Five of a Kind (five cards of the same rank), Flush House (a full house with all cards of the same suit) and Flush Five (five cards of the same rank and suit). In order to get the planet cards of these hands, which are Planet X (Five of a Kind), Ceres (Flush House) and Eris (Flush Five); the specific hand needs to have been played at least once that run.

Ost from Fiverr - The ost (soundtrack) of the game wasn’t actually composed by LocalThunk himself, but from someone that was commissioned to do it on the website Fiverr. The composer’s pseudonym is LouisF (Louissoundtrack on the website).

Mods - Like any other game, Balatro has some fan developed mods, the most notorious of those probably is the Cryptid mod (made by MathIsFun_), made to be purposefully really unbalanced.

Different Planet Scaling - By reading the description of the planet cards it can be noticed that harder to make hands get more base mult and chips per planet card used. For example, Pluto gives +10 chips and +1 mult to High Card, while Neptune gives +40 chips and +4 mult to Straight Flush.

Ectoplasm Cumulative Debuff - Using Ectoplasm takes away one card from your hand size, but using another Ectoplasm doesn’t do the same thing; instead, it takes away two cards from your hand size, and, next time you use it, it takes three away, then four, then five. This is why (unless you’re doing a Baron-Mime build) most of the time it is optimal to take just two Ectoplasms, bringing your hand size between five and seven. This way you’ll still be able to play five-card hands.

FOURTH LAYER

Judgement/Riff-Raff Negatives - It may not be that well known, but Judgement and Riff-Raff both are able to generate Jokers with editions, that means also negative Jokers. Both have the probability to create a negative Joker of 0.3% per Joker generated.

Eternals’ Interaction - The eternal sticker isn’t always a disadvantage. The main type of run in which eternal stickers become a blessing are Madness runs. Madness is a Joker that gains x0.5 mult per Small or Big Blind played and destroys a random Joker in your roster while doing so. Eternal Jokers cannot be destroyed by Madness, that makes Madness viable to use with other Jokers. The other scenario in which eternal Jokers are good is while playing Ghost Deck, that’s due to the high amount of Ankhs and Hexes (Ankh makes a copy of a random Joker and destroys all the others, Hex makes a random Joker polychrome and destroys all the others), which can lead to making multiple copies of a single Joker.

Retrigger Balancing - If you have Jokers that give multiplicative mult upon scoring cards and Jokers that retrigger said cards, and also have some Blueprints, it is better to balance the Blueprint copies between those two Jokers instead of putting all of them on one or the other. Something which is to keep in mind is that cards themselves already have one retrigger and that if they all have a red seal that’s two retriggers from the cards alone. Also, if the cards are made of glass in an Idol run or made of steel in a Baron run that means they score once by themselves. It is better to prioritize the scoring Joker when the numbers of scoring and retriggering are one apart. Let’s say you have a Triboulet, Sock and Buskin, three copies of Blueprint and red seal lucky kings; in this situation you have two retriggers and zero scoring from the cards alone, one scoring from Triboulet and one retrigger from Sock and Buskin. If you were to triple-copy Triboulet, you would get four scoring and three retriggers; that’s optimal.

Serpent Farming - The Serpent is a Boss Blind in which every time you play a hand or discard, it always draws three cards to your hand. Thanks to this Boss Blind you are able to go over your hand size limit, since you gain +2 temporary hand size per hand or discard used (assuming you just play or discard one card). In Baron-Mime builds hand size is key, since often it is the limiting factor to how many chips that setup can score. If you also happen to have a Burglar (gives +3 hands but lose all discards) you can copy it (with Blueprints) at the start of the blind, to get something like fifteen to twenty hands; you play all of these hands, except the last one, without copying Baron and Mime, to not win the round accidentally. This way you can play one last hand copying optimally getting a very big (relative to your normal) score. Though not every Boss Blind is the Serpent, and the Serpent has the same chance to appear as any other boss. To get the Serpent reliantly you must have the Ret-Con voucher and at least three-hundred dollars, which should be enough money to let you find the Serpent while rerolling.

Misprint Tech - The glitchy description of this Joker has a chance to go from being “+0-23 Mult” to being “#@[number][letter]”. In the latter description the numbers can go from one to thirteen and the letters can either S, H, C, or D. This second description tells us the rank and suit of the next card to be drawn: one stands for Ace, eleven for Jack, twelve for Queen and thirteen for King; while the letters represent the suit (S for Spades, H for Hearts, C for Clubs and D for Diamonds).

Glitched Seeds - Playing some seeds in this game may have some unique consequences on the run, though that is pretty rare. There have been discovered some seeds which appear to be bugged or glitched, some examples may be the seed that when played on erratic deck makes you start with a full deck of only tens of spades (7LB2WVPK), and the seed that has only rare Jokers in the shop (MIPK41M6).

Legendaries’ Backstory - The legendary Jokers’ names and looks in Balatro each come from real Jesters that have historically existed, either as real people or as characters. I’m listing their Wikipedia pages: Canio (doesn’t have his own page), Perkeo, Triboulet, Yorick, Chicot.

Discarding Whole Deck - If you were to discard your whole deck you would instantly lose.

Jokerless - The last challenge to unlock in the “challenge” section is called “Jokerless”, its whole thing is that you have no Joker slots and Jokers and Buffoon Packs cannot appear in the shop. The way this challenge is beatable is thanks to the increased amount of tarots and planet cards, due to the fact that Jokers do not appear. It’s considered a great achievement to beat Jokerless in the community and some people (like drspectred) even have beaten it even on a normal deck on gold stake.

Amber Acorn strat - Though the Amber Acorn may appear devastating to a new player, knowing some strategies to counter it makes it a breeze to beat: looking for jiggling Jokers like Trading Card, DNA or Invisible Joker; if you have eternals, click on your Jokers, the ones that have the “Sell” button greyed out are the eternals; if you have one or more Brainstorms, play a throwaway hand and see which Joker is your main scoring Joker, and then put that Joker at the leftmost position.

Consumable Holding - Balatro will only show items that you don’t already have in the shops or packs (except when having “Showman”). This means that by holding some unwanted consumables in your inventory you are able to narrow the items that you will encounter. This can be an efficient strategy to getting only some kinds of planet cards or tarots.

“Balatro” Meaning - We don’t know why LocalThuk chose “Balatro” as the name of the game, but what we do know is that it is a latin word that means “buffoon”, “fool”, “jester” and “joker”.

FIFTH LAYER

Completionist++ - Completing 100% of the game results into getting the Steam achievement “Completionist++”. In order to do that you need to unlock all of the collection, complete all the challenges, complete gold stake on every deck and get a gold sticker on all the Jokers. 0.5% of Balatro Steam players have that achievement.

Wheel of Fortune is Bad - If you wanted to get more than five Jokers, without waiting to get Antimatter, you would have to use Ectoplasm. The Wheel of Fortune has a 25% chance to give one of your Joker a random edition, if that succeeds, the Joker that just got an edition cannot be turned negative. This means that if you use too many Wheels of Fortune you will not be able to get other Jokers with Ectoplasms.

Placeholder Items - There are some items (Jokers, tarots or planet cards) that are used as sort of ‘placeholders’ in the game code. These placeholders appear when every item in its category cannot appear, which leads to the placeholder item to repeatedly reiterate at the place of its category of items. For example, the placeholder item for Jokers of every rarity is Jimbo (the first Joker of the collection), so, hypothetically, if you were to hold all sixty-one common Jokers at once (including Jimbo) in every spot in which a common Joker would’ve been there would be Jimbo. The same applies to tarots with the Strength, to planets with Pluto and to spectrals with Incantation.

Jimbo Sound Origin - LocalThunk confirms in a message on the official Balatro Discord server that the sound effect for Jimbo’s voice (the Joker that talks to you in the tutorial and at the end of runs) is just his voice pitched up.

Round 0 Legendary - It is theoretically possible to get a legendary Joker before playing a single round, though that is really unlikely to do in vanilla Balatro. The Soul may appear in Arcana and Spectral packs. Spectral Tags cannot appear in ante one, but Charm Tags (Skip Tags that give a mega Arcana pack) can. If you were to find a Soul, in a Charm Tag in ante one, then you would have a legendary before having even played a round.
(Side Note) I put this entry in “Practically Impossible” just for the sheer amount of seed rerolling that would be needed. Sure, you could maybe get one or two Legendary Jokers after two days of seed rerolling, but that doesn’t sound “practical” to me, and that’s why I gave it this categorization instead of “Strategy”. By the way, this is considering a vanilla installation of Balatro, since the Brainstorm mod gets you a seed with a Charm Tag having a Soul inside if configured to do so.

“7s are useless” - Scrolling through the Joker collection you’ll find many Jokers that synergize with specific ranks of playing cards, I’ll list some examples:


Scholar - Aces
Baron - Kings
Triboulet - Kings and Queens
Shoot the Moon - Queens
Hit the Road - Jacks
Sock and Buskin - Face Cards
Walkie-Talkie - 10s, 4s
Cloud Nine - 9s
Eight Ball - 8s
NONE FOR SEVENS
Sixth Sense - 6s
Hack - 2s, 3s, 4s, 5s
Fibonacci - Aces, 8s, 5s, 3s, 2s

As you can see, sevens, compared to every other rank, do not have a unique Joker that they synergize with, making them the worst rank to deck-fix to.

Negative Hand Size - Using Perkeo with Ankh and Ectoplasm in the consumable slots can get you many negative copies of Ankh and Ectoplasms (which ideally you should have in equal quantity). Then, while playing a blind, you can sell all of your Jokers, except that one pre-established eternal Xmult Joker that you bought, and use all of the consumables to get a great number of copies of that Joker (usually hundreds of copies). This strategy usually lets you get the “naneinf” score with Jokers that normally wouldn’t be able to achieve it. Something that is noticeable during that blind is the number of the maximum cards in hand goes to zero, that’s due to all the Ectoplasms used. Even though the number displayed is zero, the actual variable is in the negatives, that means that even if you found a hand size voucher or a hand size Joker that wouldn’t be enough to have a positive hand size. If you start a blind with a hand size of zero or less you immediately lose.

Added Sell Value - When you buy the voucher “Clearance Sale” the price and sell value of Jokers decreases by a quarter (by half if you have the upgraded voucher). With that, also the amount of money the tarot Temperance gives also decreases. The Jokers Egg and Gift Card are Jokers that increase the overall total sell value of your Jokers (Egg gains three dollars of sell value at the end of the round and Gift Card increases the sell value of every Joker by one dollar at the end of the round). If you get one of those vouchers, the value added by those Jokers doesn’t get divided, that happens only to the base sell value.

Orbital Tag Reroll - The orbital tag is a skip tag that offers to upgrade a random hand by three levels if the blind is skipped. Though, if the game is closed and reopened, the hand offered will change randomly. That means that you can get the hand you want to level up by just restarting the game over and over again.

Startup Joker Sticker - The stake sticker that Jimbo (the Joker that gives +4 mult) has on your current save file is displayed on the game startup texture of said Joker.

“Rectangle Joker” - Prior to the update 1.0.1f, Square Joker used to have a rectangular shape. Furthermore, it used to have +16 chips as a starting point for scaling instead of zero.

Observatory naneinf - Some people suggested the possibility of getting naneinf by solely using the combination of Perkeo and Observatory. While that is possible when supplementing the Observatory with another source of scoring, doing that using only the Observatory as a source of score is practically impossible, and here’s why.
For the sake of convenience and calculations let’s say we’re using High Card as our hand and it is level one (we’re stockpiling Plutos). Also, for the sake of simplicity, I’m just going to write “Blueprint” instead of “Blueprint/Brainstorm”, since both work for the build. Each Pluto added to the Observatory is x1.5 mult to the total, and we know that the score needed is circa e308. This calculation below tells me how many planets will be needed to achieve naneinf:

1.5(10308)1751 
On a normal deck:
It’s impossible.

On plasma deck:
On plasma deck, since the score is basically squared after your hand you need half as many planets. 876 planets, dividing to that the number of total rounds that can be played (120) we get 7.3. This means that, starting from ante one round zero, we need to have at least a Perkeo, a Pluto in the consumable slot, and six (and later in the run we would have to get one more) Blueprints copying Perkeo.
Impossible.
Maybe though there is still a bit of hope, the following equation may help us:

876x=9

x=97.3

I’m considering a possible total of nine Perkeo activations per round. Since we are doing High Card, we just need a hand size of one to be able to score, that means we can use three Ectoplasms (-6 hand size in total). Then we also get Antimatter, and that’s an additional Joker slot. This means we get four more Joker slots, for a total of nine Joker slots: one Perkeo and eight Blueprints. The equation tells us that we need to have nine planet doublings per round for at least 98 rounds. This gives us twenty-two rounds to find eight Blueprints, and you also need to survive with other Jokers while you do not have Observatory, that means you’ll also need Observatory before round twenty-two. I cannot stress this enough, it is really, really, really unlikely for it to happen, but on paper: it is doable.

SIXTH LAYER

Eternal Legendaries - When you use a Soul, you might get a legendary Joker with an edition, there is even a seed famous for giving you Triboulet and Perkeo naturally negative back to back (2K9H9HN). Normally, when playing on black stake or higher, you will see Jokers with stickers in the shop (eternal, perishable and rental), though you will realize that Joker generators, like Judgement and Riff-Raff, won’t give Jokers with stickers, but just with editions; like the Soul. Basically, getting eternal legendaries on a casual run is impossible. There exist two challenges called “Non-Perishable” and “Typecast” which make it possible. The first of the two makes all Jokers in the shop eternal and that applies also to generated Jokers, while the second doesn’t give Jokers stickers in the shop, but when you pass ante four all of your Jokers become eternal. That means that in those two challenges it is possible to get eternal legendaries.

Blue 8 ball - Now 8 ball is a common Joker that has 1 in 4 chance to generate a random tarot card per eight triggered, before that it had a different effect. It was an uncommon and it generated a random planet card if at least two eights were included in your scoring hand. Also, the background of the Joker’s art had a blue hue instead of a purple one, symbolizing planet cards.

Multiple Chicots - Chicot is one of the five legendary Jokers in the game, his effect is disabling every Boss Blind’s effect if you just have it. The community is really split on the opinion of this Joker, since it doesn’t contribute to the score in a meaningful way. Though there is a bug using this Joker that makes you achieve something that otherwise would be impossible. Turns out that this Joker, on some Boss Blinds, code-wise, instead of disabling the ability of the Boss it reverses it, meaning that if you were to have more than one copy of Chicot he would reverse it multiple times. One of the Boss Blinds that have their effect reversed instead of disabled, is the Manacle, which effect is making you play that Blind with one hand size less. If you were to have more than one Chicot here you would get one hand size more than your normal, but here’s the thing: you gain it permanently. What’s even better is that you get one more permanent hand size for each extra Chicot you have (if you have five Chicots you would get plus four permanent hand size). Clearly the meta is to get a really strong economy and hoard money (thousands of dollars) and always reroll the Boss to get the Manacle, then, when you find an ectoplasm, use it, and start searching for an invisible Joker to get another copy of Chicot. Rinse and repeat. It is possible to get naneinf with this strategy by having a Baron-Mime setup thanks to the really really large hand size you’ll have.

Cola-Compatible Blueprint - The uncommon Joker “Diet Cola” gives you a Double Tag when you sell it, strangely enough, it is compatible with Blueprint. This means that if you’re able to get a naturally negative Diet Cola, having a Showman, every time you find a Blueprint in the shop without being able to take it, you can just copy the Diet Cola and sell that Blueprint, to immediately buy a new one.

Matador rework - LocalThunk has mentioned in an interview with Bloomertag that he’s going to change the effect of the Joker “Matador” due to it being “confusing”.

Stake Changes - Before the 1.0.1f update, Orange and Gold stakes each had a different debuff instead of the new ones: on Orange Stake the price of booster packs in the shop would increase by one dollar each passing ante; and on Gold Stake you would have one hand size less. It is worth noting that LocalThunk has also mentioned in an interview changing the current ability of the Blue Stake (-1 discard), since it discourages playing five-card hands.

Stencil naneinf - As mentioned in the “Negative Hand Size” entry, it is possible to get incredible amounts of the same Joker for just one round and even achieve naneinf with those. The Joker Stencil has the unique ability of multiplying the mult by the number of free Joker slots (Joker slots containing a Joker Stencil count as empty), this means that if you got this way, let’s say, fifty Joker Stencils, each one would multiply the mult by fifty, and the number only increases for each other Joker Stencil that you get. It is possible to get naneinf this way.

Sneak Peek - In the shop of the demo version of Balatro, a “Sneak Peek” tab would appear on the right of the shop slots, showing Jokers and Vouchers that weren’t in the demo but were going to be in the full version of the game. If you hovered over said item, a description will appear telling you that it is only available in the full version.

Cards Showing in Shop - Sometimes after a boss blind, especially when you had many cards in hand, in the shop you’ll still see your cards held in hand of the last round overlayed on the shop.

Boss Blind’s Symbols & Name Origin - If you have ever noticed, the Boss Blind’s symbols loosely recall the letters of our modern alphabet, it is like that because those symbols are from the Phoenician alphabet, an ancestor of the Latin alphabet (ours). The name of the Blinds is the translation of the meaning of the name of the correspondent letter (source). Many of these symbols have different meanings, so when LocalThunk was naming the Boss Blinds it was on the table to name the Fish “the Camel”, or naming the Manacle like “the Weapon”.

Not “Saved!” - Mr. Bones is a Joker that prevents the end of your run when you don’t meet the scoring requirements of the blind after having used all of your hands, though it will only save you if you at least reach 25% of the scoring requirement, it self-destructs upon use displaying under it the message: “Saved!”. Though there is one instance in which it won't save you even if you got 25% of the score: decking out; if you managed to run out of cards in your deck, it will still destroy itself and say: “Saved!”, but then, after a short pause, you will be brought to the endscreen.

Sticker Criteria - While stickers are given randomly to Jokers in the shop there still exists some criteria used to determine which stickers a Joker can have. Food Jokers (Popcorn, Ice Cream, Diet Cola, Seltzer, Gros Michel, Cavendish, Ramen, Turtle Bean, etc.) cannot have the eternal sticker: this is due to the fact that those Jokers are either bound to get consumed eventually or can randomly get destroyed. Scaling Jokers (ones that start at +0 chips, +0 mult and x1 mult, and scale up) cannot be found with the perishable sticker, this may be due to game design and balancing decisions. Every Joker can be a rental.

“Chaos Theory” - This is a scrapped Joker that didn’t make the final cut into the game. We don’t know which ability it would’ve had but its sprite was drawn by the same person that drew the sprite for Vagabond (LumpyTouch).

Pack Softlock - Being “softlocked” means being stuck and unable to progress a playthrough of a videogame thanks to a bug or an unintended feature. It is possible to softlock yourself in Balatro by destroying all of the cards in your hand in a Mega Spectral/Arcana pack. After having done so you’d think that you would be able to proceed with your run by pressing the “Skip” button, but, unfortunately, that button is grayed out. This leaves you, as the only way to keep enjoying the game, starting a new run.

Rerolling Boss after Hieroglyph - The vouchers Hieroglyph and Petroglyph allow each to go back one ante, meaning, that if you were at ante nine, got back to ante eight and rerolled the boss you would reroll into a finisher boss blind from a normal boss blind. The same can be done the other way around: being at ante eight, taking the voucher and rerolling into a normal boss blind instead of the finisher one. The former of the two interactions could be used as a strategy to get to see more finisher boss blinds (to maybe perform the “Crimson Bean” exploit, more on that later).
SEVENTH LAYER

Unused Stake Texture - There is a stake texture in the game files that looks like the White Stake texture but with the face of Jimbo put on top of it. The developer said on the official Discord server that that image was created just for fun.

Save Scumming - If an unfortunate aleatory event (like an Ectoplasm landing on the wrong Joker or a Soul giving not the legendary you wanted) happens it is possible to get back in time to just before it happens. What you need to do is pressing Alt + F4 just after the unlucky event has occurred to close the game, once the game is reloaded you should be to just moments before its happening. This technique is called “Save Scumming” and it’s often considered “cheating” or detrimental to strategic plays.

Crimson Bean - This is a bug that allows you to gain extra permanent hand size by having the “Turtle Bean” Joker and playing the Crimson Heart finisher Boss Blind. The Turtle Bean is a Joker that gives +5 hand size but the hand size it gives decreases by one at the end of each round, once the increased hand size goes to zero the Joker destroys itself. If the Crimson Heart disables the Turtle Bean you’ll see under your hand that you have more cards in hand than the normal number. If you then get to the main title and get back into the run you’ll see that it is not the same anymore and that if you were to discard some cards you would still get them back. If you now play a hand, so that the Turtle Bean is re-enabled, you’ll gain the same hand size in the description of the Joker, but now it is permanent. It can be paired with a Burglar so that you can get like twenty extra hand sizes in just a single Boss Blind. The upside to this over having multiple Chicots is the fact that you don’t need a legendary Joker, though it needs more setup than the Chicot method.

Negative Invisible Joker - If you were to find a negative Invisible Joker, having all the Joker slots full, you’d think that upon selling it you wouldn’t get any copies of your Jokers, right? Though, it’s quite the opposite: you get a copy of a random Joker in your roster as usual, but your Joker count goes over the number of slots available. This strange interaction also makes it so you cannot get natural negatives anymore.

Glass Imperfection - By looking at the texture of a glass card, you can see to the mid-bottom right of the card an imperfection: two horizontal pixels the same color of the glass’ reflections. I don’t think it is intentional.

“Sans Undertale Ante Skip” - Yes, this actually exists. It is a glitch involving Boss Blinds and two Mr. Bones that lets the player skip an incredible number of antes. One player managed to get to ante 315, which is otherwise impossible. This is definitely one of the strangest glitches in the game.

Deterministic Randomness - While probabilistic events (like lucky card triggers or glass cards breaking) might seem random at first, looking at the game’s code reveals that each seed has predetermined times at which random events occur; meaning, if you were to play the same seed in exactly the same way you would get the same random outcomes.

Reroll Tag uses Director’s Cut - If you skip a blind with a reroll tag, which is a tag that rerolls the Boss Blind, while having the Voucher “Director’s Cut” (but not its upgraded one), the button that lets you reroll the Boss Blind will gray out, even though you haven’t used it. This must mean that the developer reused the code from Director’s Cut for making the reroll tag, but forgot to delete the part which makes the reroll button gray.

Polychrome Hue Shifting - Polychrome cards are known for their rainbow look, though that rainbow overlay after some time (six years approximately on desktop version, six hours approximately on mobile) breaks. It starts changing by displaying three colors at a time: red, yellow and blue; that after some time become green and purple. After that all the colors briefly turn back to blue to at the end become all black.

What’s the Soul? - The “Soul” spectral card spawns a legendary Joker in your roster if you have at least a free Joker slot, though it is the only spectral card to have an animated sprite overlaid on it. The sprite looks like a pointy and sharp gray stone, pulsating to a heartbeat. Some users suggested it might be a reference to the “Soul Stones” consumables from the hit videogame “The Binding of Isaac”.

EIGHTH LAYER

Ante -1 - By skipping on the first blind of the game for a Voucher Tag, playing the Big Blind and putting the game speed at x0.5, it is possible to get a voucher in the next shop before the Voucher Tag triggers. This means that, if the first voucher is Hieroglyph, and the voucher that spawns is Petroglyph, and you have enough money (only possible on Yellow Deck); it is possible to get to ante negative one, which works functionally the same as ante zero.

Jokerless naneinf - I’ve already covered in the “Observatory naneinf” entry that the number of retriggers x1.5 mult needed to get naneinf is 1751, and it is halved on Plasma Deck (876). Kings of steel are used to achieve this scoring, ones with a red seal trigger twice; so, assuming we only use red seal steel kings we just need 438 kings (on Plasma). We can get that number of kings in hand by using 219 cryptids, obtainable using Perkeo. The way we can get a cryptid spectral card in our consumable slot is by using Sèance or Sixth Sense.

You die after losing - The description of the Joker “Mr. Bones” reads: 
“Prevents Death if chips scored are at least 25% of required chips. Self destructs”.
The first two words, “Prevents Death”, with the fact that the Joker allows you to keep playing if you fail to meet the scoring quota, means that you canonically die after losing in Balatro.

Rerolling into the Same Boss Blind - Balatro makes all the Boss Blinds show up once in a random order before making them show up again. This means that if you were to reroll the last Boss Blind of that order all of the Boss Blinds could show up again: even the same one. This happened to the player Roffle in this video.

Every Seed is Winnable - When drspectred completed his self-imposed challenge of getting Completionist++ without losing once the debate started around the concept that maybe, thanks to the balancing of the game, there does not exist a seed which truly is impossible to win, though that seems really unlikely, since there are 2.82 trillion (2,820,000,000,000) seeds in the game. There was found a seed which would be extremely hard on gold stake due to it being bugged, it was initially thought to be impossible, but after further testing it was proven to be possible. This doesn’t weed out other possibilities for impossible seeds though, which may be caused by other bugs.

$naneinf - It is theoretically possible to get “infinite” money in the game. First you need to get all of the tarots (except the fool) in your consumable slots (through Perkeo). After that you use an emperor in the shop, it will give you a fool and a strength, you sell the strength and use the fool, you can repeat this process how many times you like and every time you do it you gain one dollar, so “technically” you have “infinite” money. In practice it is impossible to get naneinf money, since let’s assume you do this process once a second, that means you gain one dollar a second and you’ll need 1.79 x 10^308 seconds to get naneinf money, or 5.39 x 10^300 years.

Chips Only naneinf - Hypothetically, if you got naneinf money you’d just need the Bull (gives +2 chips for each dollar you have) Joker to get naneinf with just chips!

All Just a Deck - Every single lootbox in Balatro, shops, packs, Judgements, Emperors, is just a continuous string of cards that get presented one after the other when they can. The cards that show up in the shop have a preexisting order in which they show up and then get grouped by two, three or four per shop reroll based on your vouchers, same applies for every single lootbox in the game: they are basically conveyor belts of cards. If you really think about it, these “conveyors” are just decks of cards.
